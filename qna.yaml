  - context: |
      Bodywork declared as “Rear Wing Profiles” must:
      a.Lie within RV-RW-PROFILES.
      b.In any Y plane:
      i.Contain exactly two sections.
      ii.The rearmost section, which will be known as the “RW Flap”, must have a chord
      smaller than the chord of the adjacent section.
      iii. With the exception of minimal modifications to permit attachment of the actuator
      system described in 3.10.10 to the RW Flap, the sections may not contain any
      concave radius of curvature smaller than 100mm
      Furthermore:
      3.10.2
      c.At all points along the span, the rear wing profiles (as defined under Article 3.10.1) must
      have a minimum gap of between 9.4mm and 13mm. This will apply when the DRS is not
      in the state of deployment (as defined under Article 3.10.10) and will be measured with
      a spherical gauge.
      d.Outboard of Y100, the normal to any point of the profiles surface must not subtend an
      angle greater than 20° to a Y plane.
      e.Once the RW Flap is fully defined, a Gurney of up to 20mm may be fitted to the trailing
      edge. This Gurney is considered to be part of the Rear Wing Profiles and must satisfy
      the provisions of this Article with the exception of sections b (iii) and (d).
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How should a rear wing profile should be designed?
        answer: |
          It must comply to the two following requirements: First, it must lie within RV-RW-PROFILES. Second, it must contain exactly two sections in any Y plane. The rearmost section, known as the "RW Flap", must have a chord smaller than the chord of the adjacent section except for minimal modifications to permit attachment of the actuator system described in 3.10.10 to the RW Flap.
      - question: What is the minimum gap between the rear wing profiles?
        answer: |
          The minimum gap between the rear wing profiles must be between 9.4mm and 13mm. This applies when the DRS is not in the state of deployment and will be measured with a spherical gauge.
      - question: What is the maximum angle that the normal to any point of the profiles surface can subtend to a Y plane?
        answer: |
          The maximum angle that the normal to any point of the profiles surface can subtend to a Y plane is 20°.
      - question: How much gap should the the rear wing profiles have along the span?
        answer: |
          The span of the rear wing profiles, at all points, must be between a minimum of 9.4mm and 13mm.

      Bodywork declared as “Rear Wing Pylon” must:

      a.Lie within RV-RW-PYLON.

      b.On any Z plane, when considering both sides of the car, only contain no
      more than two

      closed symmetrical sections with a maximum total area of 5000mm2. This
      does not

      apply if the complete section lies within 30mm of the Exhaust Tailpipe
      defined in Article

      3.8.2. For any complete closed section outside of RV-TAIL-EXH, the
      thickness of each

      section may not exceed 25mm when measured in the Y direction.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Which are the two requirements that we need for the rear wing pylon?
        answer: >-
          The first requirement is that it must lie within RV-RW-PYLON and the
          second one is that on the Z plan (Considering both sides of the car),
          it should only contain no more than two closed symmetrical sections
          with a maximum total area of 5000mm2
      - question: >-
          Are there any exceptions to the requirements to the fact that the rear
          wing pylon only contain no more than two closed symmetrical sections
          with a maximum total area of 5000mm2?
        answer: >-
          Yes, those does not apply if the complete section lies within 30mm of
          the Exhaust Tailpipe defined in Article 3.8.2. For any complete closed
          section outside of RV-TAIL-EXH, the thickness of each section may not
          exceed 25mm in the each Y direction.
      - question: What is the maximum area of the rear wing pylon?
        answer: >-
          The maximum area of the rear wing pylon is 5000mm2. This does not
          apply if the complete section lies within 30mm of the Exhaust Tailpipe
          defined in Article 3.8.2.

# 3.10.7 Rear Wing Endplate
  - context: >-
      Once the Rear Wing Endplate Body and Rear Wing Tip are fully defined they must be joined
      to create one unified volume with no remaining overlapping surfaces. The resultant volume,
      known as the Rear Wing Endplate must be arranged such that, when viewed from the side of
      the car, no part of RS-RW-RWEP, may be visible. Furthermore, the external surfaces at the
      boundaries between adjacent sections of the Rear Wing Endplate Body and Rear Wing Tip
      must maintain both continuity and tangency in any X, Y or Z plane.

      - question: What is the requirement for the Rear Wing Endplate Body and Rear Wing Tip?
        answer: >-
          The requirement is that once they are fully defined, they must be joined to create one 
          unified volume with no remaining overlapping surfaces. The resultant volume when viewed 
          from the side of the car must have no part of the RS-RW-RWEP visible. This is known as 
          the Rear Wing Endplate.
      - question: What is the requirement for the external surfaces at the boundaries between 
          adjacent sections of the Rear Wing Endplate Body and Rear Wing Tip?
