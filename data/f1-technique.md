## ARTICLE 1: GENERAL PRINCIPLES

## 1.1 Formula One World Championship

- 1.1.1 The FIA will organise the FIA Formula One World Championship (the "Championship") which is the property of the FIA and comprises two titles of World Champion, one for drivers and one for constructors. It consists of the Formula One Grand Prix races which are included in the Formula One calendar and in respect of which the ASNs and organisers have signed organisation agreements with the FIA. All the participating parties (FIA, ASNs, organisers, competitors and circuits) undertake to apply as well as observe the rules governing the Championship and must hold FIA Super Licences which are issued to drivers, competitors, officials, organisers and circuits.
- 1.1.2 The Championship and each of its Competitions are governed by the FIA in accordance with the Regulations.
- 1.1.3 In the sense of the Regulations, terms referring to natural persons are applicable to any gender.

## 1.2 Regulatory Framework

- 1.2.1 The Regulations applicable to the Championship are the International Sporting Code (the 'Code'), the Formula One Technical Regulations (the 'Technical Regulations'), the Formula One Sporting Regulations (the 'Sporting Regulations'), and the Formula One Financial Regulations (the 'Financial Regulations'), together referred to as the 'Regulations'.
- 1.2.2 These Regulations are issued by the FIA and apply to the whole calendar year referred to in the title and to the Championship taking place within that calendar year. Any changes made by the FIA for safety reasons may come into effect without notice or delay.
- 1.2.3 The definitive text of the Technical Regulations shall be the English version which will be used should any dispute arise as to their interpretation. Headings in this document are for ease of reference only and do not affect the meaning of the Technical Regulations.

## 1.3 Dangerous construction

The stewards may prohibit the participation of a vehicle whose construction is deemed to be dangerous. Should the relevant information become apparent during a session, such a decision may apply with immediate effect.

## 1.4 Compliance with the regulations

Formula 1 Cars must comply with these regulations in their entirety at all times during a Competition.

Should a Competitor introduce a new design or system or feel that any aspect of these regulations is unclear, clarification may be sought from the FIA Formula One Technical Department. If clarification relates to any new design or system, correspondence must include:

- a. A full description of the design or system.
- b. Drawings or schematics where appropriate.
- c. The Competitor's opinion concerning the immediate implications on other parts of the car of any proposed new design.
- d. The Competitor's opinion concerning any possible long term consequences or new developments which may come from using any such new designs or systems.
- e. The precise way or ways in which the Competitor feels the new design or system will enhance the performance of the car.

26 February 2025

## 1.5 New systems or technologies

Any new system, procedure or technology not specifically covered by these regulations, but which is deemed permissible by the FIA Formula One Technical Department, will only be admitted until the end of the Championship during which it is introduced. Following this the Formula One Commission will be asked to review the technology concerned and, if they feel it adds no value to Formula One in general, it may be specifically prohibited by the FIA.

Any team whose technology is prohibited in this way will then be required to publish full technical details of the relevant system or procedure.

## 1.6 Duty of Competitor

It is the duty of each Competitor to satisfy the FIA technical delegate and the stewards that his Formula 1 Car complies with these regulations in their entirety at all times during a Competition.

The design of the car, its components and systems shall, with the exception of safety features, demonstrate their compliance with these regulations by means of physical inspection of hardware or materials. Unless explicitly requested by an Article, no mechanical design may rely upon software inspection as a means of ensuring its compliance.

Due to their nature, the compliance of electronic systems may be assessed by means of inspection of hardware, software and data.

CAD models may be requested by the FIA in order to check compliance with the Regulations. Such models should be supplied in a format and by a method specified by the FIA. In such cases, scanning technology will be used by the FIA to check that the physical car is the same as the inspected CAD models.

Each competitor must ensure that all relevant personnel (whether employee, consultant, contractor, secondee or any other type of permanent or temporary personnel) associated with its participation in the Championship are appropriately informed with respect to the ways in which their areas of responsibility may impact the competitor's compliance with the Regulations.

Each competitor must ensure that the FIA ethics and compliance hotline with respect to the Regulations is clearly communicated to all these individuals.

26 February 2025

## 2.10 Reference Volumes and Surfaces

'Reference Volumes' and 'Reference Surfaces' and their position in space are defined in Appendix 1 using the car's coordinate system, and are used throughout the Technical Regulations for geometrical constraints. For convenience, Reference Volumes are preceded by the prefix ' RV' and Reference Surfaces by the prefix ' RS-'.

## 2.11 Coordinate system and references

- 2.11.1 A right-handed Cartesian (X, Y, Z) coordinate system will be used in these regulations, defined in the following way:
- a. The X axis is in the rearwards longitudinal direction, and is parallel to the reference and car centre planes. Depending on the regulation in question, the local origin can vary, and the following convention is used:
- i. XA=0mm is defined to be on plane A-A
- ii. XB=0mm is defined to be on plane B-B
- iii. XC=0mm is defined to be on plane C-C
- iv. The planes XF=0 and XR=0 are defined as the planes which respectively pass through the origin of the two front or two rear wheels' coordinate systems, as defined in Article 2.11.3, with the wheels in the straight ahead position and the car at the Legality Ride Height, as defined in Article 10.1.4.
- v. XDIF =0mm is defined as the output axis of the final drive as defined in Article 9.6.1.
- vi. XPU=0mm is defined to pass through the forward most mounting face of the studs connecting the power unit to the survival cell, as defined in Article 5.4.8.
- b. The Y axis is normal to the X axis, parallel to the reference plane, and pointing to the right hand side of the car. Y=0mm is defined to be on the car centre plane.
- c. The Z axis is normal to the reference plane and points upwards. Z=0mm is defined to be on the reference plane

## 2.11.2 Further conventions:

- a. If no units are specified, it is implicit the unit will be in millimetres
- b. The suffix 'L' may be used for local coordinates in specific rules, i.e. XL, YL, ZL, where these local axes are defined within a specific Article for local use.
- c. Planes will be referred to as the axis to which they are normal to (e.g. X-plane or XA=300 plane).
- d. Unless otherwise specified, the positive side of the Y axis is used in the various articles and it is implicit that a symmetrical rule applies for the other side of the car. The terms 'inboard' or 'outboard', when used in reference to the Y coordinate, respectively refer to closer to or further away from the car centre plane.
- e. Unless otherwise specified any measurements and references will be with the wheels in the straight ahead position (the wheel rotation axis lying within an X plane).
- f. Unless otherwise specified, when a viewing direction is stated, 'front' and 'rear' are parallel to the X axis, 'side' is parallel to the Y axis (in the direction towards the car centre plane) and 'above', 'below' and 'plan' are parallel to the Z axis.
- g. Unless otherwise specified, directions of angles, slopes and incidences are taken in context of the right-handed Cartesian coordinate system defined in 2.11.1. For example, a positive slope within a Y-Plane would be characterised by positively increasing X and Z components.

26 February 2025

- 2.11.3 A Cartesian (XW, YW, ZW) coordinate system will be used for each wheel, defined in the following way:
- a. The XW axis lies on the inboard plane of the wheel rim, passes through its rotational axis and points in the rearward longitudinal direction. XW=0mm is defined to be on the wheel rotational axis. The XW axis is parallel to the car centre plane and to the reference plane, with the wheel in the straight-ahead position and the car at its legality ride height, as defined in Article 10.1.4.
- b. The YW axis is normal to the inboard plane of the wheel rim and points towards the car centre plane. YW=0mm is defined to be on the inboard plane of the wheel rim. Referring to this coordinate, the terms 'inboard' or 'outboard' respectively refer to closer to or further away from the car centre plane.
- c. The ZW axis is normal to both the XW and YW axes and points upwards. ZW=0 is defined to be on the wheel rotational axis.
- d. Once the wheel axis system is defined as above, then it maintains a fixed orientation relative to the suspension upright at all other suspension articulation points.

## 2.12 Precision of Numerical Values

Any numerical values specified in these Regulations as limits (maxima or minima), will be considered to be the limits regardless of the decimals quoted.

26 February 2025

## ARTICLE 3: AERODYNAMIC COMPONENTS

## 3.1 Definitions

## 3.1.1 Aerodynamic Components or Bodywork

All parts of the car in contact with the external air stream.

- a. The following components are considered to be bodywork:
- i. all components described in Article 3;
- ii. inlet or outlet ducts for the purpose of cooling, up to the component they are intended to provide cooling for;
- iii. inlet ducts for the power unit (air boxes) up to the air filter;
- iv. primary heat exchangers, as defined in Article 7.4.1 (b).
- b. The following components are not considered to be bodywork:
- i. cameras and camera housings, as defined in Article 8.17;
- ii. rear view mirrors as defined in Article 14.2;
- iii. the ERS status light;
- iv. parts definitely associated with the mechanical functioning of the power train, transmission of power to the wheels, and the steering system providing, in any case, none are of a design contrived to achieve an aerodynamic effect;
- v. the wheel rims and tyres;
- vi. the brake disc assemblies, calipers and pads.

## 3.1.2 Frame of Reference

The geometry, component or group of components with respect to which certain bodywork must remain immobile.

## 3.1.3 External air stream

The flow of air around the car which has a primary impact on its aerodynamic performance.

## 3.1.4 Concave and convex curvature

References made in this Article on curvature of aerodynamic surfaces refer to the part of the aerodynamic surface which is in contact with the external air stream.

When references are made to the curvature of a surface, without specifying an intersection with a particular plane, the local curvature at any point will be defined as the curvature of the intersection of the surface in question with a plane passing through a line normal to the surface at that point. The concave radius of curvature of the surface at that point will be defined as the minimum concave radius of curvature obtained when the intersecting plane is swept through 180 degrees around the normal line. The convex radius of curvature of that surface at that point will be defined as the minimum convex radius of curvature obtained when the intersecting plane is swept through 180 degrees around the normal line.

As an example, and for the sake of clarity, the aerodynamic surface of a solid sphere would be the surface where this sphere makes contact with the external airstream, and would be considered to be a convex surface.

## 3.1.5 Normal to an aerodynamic surface or curve

The normal applied to an aerodynamic surface at a given point is a vector which is perpendicular to the surface at that point and points towards the local external air stream.

The normal to a curve at a given point will be considered to be the normal to the surface containing the curve at the same point.

26 February 2025

## 3.1.6 Tangency Continuity

Tangency Continuity at a given point of a curve or at a given point of a surface, is satisfied if the value of the tangent is continuous.

Tangency Continuity at intersections between two curves or two surfaces, is satisfied if the two curves or two surfaces at the intersection are tangent to one another and also have their normal coincident with each other.

Where two adjacent surfaces are not tangent continuous but could be made so by applying an edge radius of no more than 1mm along their boundary, these surfaces will be considered tangent continuous at this boundary whether or not the edge radius is applied, as long as such an edge radius is permitted according to the relevant article.

## 3.1.7 Curvature Continuity

Curvature Continuity between two curves, at a given point of a curve, between two surfaces or within a surface is satisfied if the value of the curvature is continuous and in the same direction.

## 3.1.8 Open and closed sections

Within the prescribed limitations of the relevant regulation, a section through the bodywork when intersected with a defined plane will be considered closed if it forms a complete boundary by itself otherwise it will be considered open.

## 3.1.9 Fillet and Edge Radius

A fillet radius is formed by rounding an internal corner (included angle less than 180 degrees) with a concave surface by only adding material, whilst an edge radius is created by smoothing an external corner (included angle greater than 180 degrees) with a convex surface by only removing material.

In both cases the resultant surface must be formed by arcs with radius of curvature respecting the limit(s) specified, connecting two fully defined surfaces tangentially with no inflection and perpendicular to the intersection between them. Unless otherwise specified, both fillet and edge radii may change in magnitude around the periphery of the boundary around which they are defined, but such changes must be continuous.

If there exists a discontinuity in tangency at the trailing edge of the intersection between the parts to be joined by a fillet radius, then a closed aerodynamic fairing may be added immediately behind the trailing edge. This fairing must be no larger in cross section than the preceding fillet radius and any trailing edge immediately adjacent to the fillet and no longer than three times the maximum fillet arc radius at this point.

## 3.1.10 Aerodynamic seal

The function by which the flow between two regions of different pressure is kept to the minimum feasible magnitude.

## 3.1.11 Gurney

A component fitted to the trailing edge of a profile in order to adjust its aerodynamic performance. In any plane normal to the trailing edge of the profile, the Gurney must contain a flat section no more than 1mm thick, and of a given height (defined as the size of the Gurney), and a bonding flange onto the surface of the wing which may be no more than 20mm long and 1mm thick. No part of the Gurney may protrude behind a line that is normal to the surface on which the Gurney is applied at the point of the trailing edge of the profile.

## 3.2 General Principles and Legality Checking

## 3.2.1 Objective of Article 3

An important objective of the Regulations in Article 3 is to enable cars to race closely, by ensuring that the aerodynamic performance loss of a car following another car is kept to a minimum. In order to verify whether this objective has been achieved, Competitors may be required on request to supply the FIA with any relevant information.

26 February 2025

In any case the Intellectual Property of this information, will remain the property of the Competitor, will be protected and not divulged to any third party.

## 3.2.2 Aerodynamic Influence

With the exception of the driver adjustable bodywork, when in the state of deployment, as described in Article 3.10.10 (in addition to minimal parts solely associated with its actuation) and the flexible seals specifically permitted by Articles 3.13 and 3.14.4, all aerodynamic components or bodywork influencing the car's aerodynamic performanc e must be rigidly secured and immobile with respect to their frame of reference defined in Article 3.3. Furthermore, these components must produce a uniform, solid, hard, continuous, impervious surface under all circumstances.

Any device or construction that is designed to bridge the gap between the sprung part of the car and the ground is prohibited under all circumstances.

With the exception of the parts necessary for the adjustment described in Article 3.10.10, or any incidental movement due to the steering system, any car system, device or procedure which uses driver movement as a means of altering the aerodynamic characteristics of the car is prohibited.

The Aerodynamic influence of any component of the car not considered to be bodywork must be incidental to its main function. Any design which aims to maximise such an aerodynamic influence is prohibited.

## 3.2.3 Symmetry

All bodywork must be nominally symmetrical with respect to Y=0. Consequently, and unless otherwise specified, any regulation in Article 3 concerning one side of the car will be assumed to be valid for the other side of the car and references to maximum permissible numbers of components in Article 3 will also refer to the one side of the car.

Minimal exceptions to the requirement of symmetry of this Article will be accepted for the installation of non-symmetrical mechanical components of the car, for asymmetrical cooling requirements or for asymmetrical angle adjustment of the front flap defined in Article 3.9.7.

Bodywork on the unsprung mass must respect this Article when the suspension position of each wheel is virtually re-orientated so that its wheel coordinate system axes (described in Article 2.11.3) are parallel to their respective axis of the car coordinate system (described in Article 2.11.1).

## 3.2.4 Digital legality checking

The assessment of the car's compliance with the Aerodynamic Regulations will be carried out digitally using CAD models provided by the teams. In these models:

- a. Components may only be designed to the edge of a Reference Volume or with a precise geometrical feature, or to the limit of a geometrical criterion (save for the normal round-off discrepancies of the CAD system), when the regulations specifically require an aspect of the bodywork to be designed to this limit, or it can be demonstrated that the design does not rely on lying exactly on this limit to conform to the regulations, such that it is possible for the physical bodywork to comply.
- b. Components which must follow a precise shape, surface or plane must be designed without any tolerance, save for the normal round-off discrepancies of the CAD system.

## 3.2.5 Physical legality checking

The cars may be measured during a Competition in order to check their conformance to the CAD models discussed in Article 3.2.4 and to ensure they remain inside the Reference Volumes.

- a. Unless otherwise specified, a tolerance of ±3mm will be accepted for manufacturing purposes only with respect to the CAD surfaces. Where measured surfaces lie outside of this tolerance but remain within the Reference Volumes, a Competitor may be required to provide additional information (e.g. revised CAD geometry) to demonstrate

26 February 2025

compliance with the regulations. Any discrepancies contrived to create a special aerodynamic effect or surface finish will not be permitted.

- b. Irrespective of a), geometrical discrepancies at the limits of the Reference Volumes must be such that the measured component remains inside the Reference Volume.
- c. A positional tolerance of +/- 2mm will be accepted for the Front Wing Bodywork, Rear Wing Bodywork, Exhaust Tailpipe, Floor Bodywork behind XR=0, and Tail. This will be assessed by realigning each of the groups of Reference Volumes and Reference Surfaces that define the assemblies, by up to 2mm from their original position, to best fit the measured geometry.
- d. Irrespective of b), a tolerance of Z=+/-2mm will be accepted for parts of the car lying on the Z=0 plane, with -375 ≤ Y ≤ 375 and ahead of XR=0.
- e. Minimal discrepancies from the CAD surfaces will also be accepted in the following cases:
- i. Minimal repairs carried out on aerodynamic components and approved by the FIA
- ii. Tape, provided it does not achieve an aerodynamic effect otherwise not permitted by Article 3
- iii. Junctions between bodywork panels
- iv. Local bodywork fixing details

## 3.2.6 Datum Points

All cars must be equipped with mountings for optical targets that enable the car 's datum to be determined for scrutineering in the following locations:

- i. One on the forward part of the top of the survival cell.
- ii. Two positioned symmetrically about Y=0 on the top of the survival cell close to XB=0.
- iii. Two positioned symmetrically about Y=0 on the side of the survival cell close to XB=0.
- iv. Two positioned symmetrically about Y=0 on the side of the survival cell close to the rear mounts of the secondary roll structure.
- v. Two positioned symmetrically about Y=0 within an axis-aligned cuboid with an interior diagonal defined by points [XC=0, 175, 970] and [XC=150, -175, 870].
- vi. One probed point on the RIS or gearbox case.

In all cases, a file with required datum points must be supplied for each survival cell.

For deflection testing, all cars must be provided with a means of mounting a reference artefact to the RIS. This mounting may be temporary, but must be rigid with respect to the underlying car structure.

Full details of the requirements are given in the Appendix the Technical and Sporting Regulations.

- 3.2.7 Section titles and Article titles within this article have no regulatory value.
- 3.2.8 Static pressure tappings are permitted in surfaces, provided that they;
- i. Have an internal diameter of no more than 2mm.
- ii. They are flush with the underlying geometry.
- iii. Are only connected to pressure sensors, or are blanked, without leakage.

## 3.3 Component Definition

The permitted bodywork and the relevant frame of reference (as defined in Article 3.1.2, and used to establish compliance with Article 3.2.2) for each group is defined in the following Articles 3.3.1, 3.3.2 and 3.3.3.

26 February 2025

## 3.3.1 Bodywork which is part of the sprung mass of the car

The only sprung mass bodywork permitted is that defined under Articles 3.5 to 3.12 and under Articles 3.1.1.a.ii to iv. The frame of reference for every part of the car classified as Sprung Mass Bodywork is the coordinate system defined in Article 2.11.1.

Any bodywork that is trimmed or filleted in Article 3.11 must first be declared as belonging to one of the groups defined in Articles 3.5 to 3.10.

Unless otherwise stated, the compliance of an individual bodywork group to Article 3 will be assessed independently and prior to any trimming, filleting and assembly operation referred to in Article 3.11, and the FIA may request to see any discarded geometry after final assembly.  Once the final assembly is completed, any bodywork surfaces no longer exposed to an external airstream or internal duct may be modified, providing they remain unexposed.

## 3.3.2 Wheel Bodywork

The only wheel bodywork permitted is that defined under Article 3.13. With the exception of wheel covers, as defined in Article 3.13.7, the frame of reference for every part of the car classified as Wheel Bodywork is the corresponding upright structure and the corresponding coordinate system defined in Article 2.11.3.

The frame of reference for any wheel cover, as defined in Article 3.13.7 is the corresponding wheel rim.

## 3.3.3 Suspension Fairings

- ii. Produce no more than one curve when intersected with any X plane, at no point along this curve may a line tangent to it subtend an angle greater than 25° to the Y-Axis.
- b. Once the virtual surface has been defined, the Front Wing Diveplane must:
- i. Fully enclose the entire virtual surface.
- ii. Be no more than 6mm distant from the virtual surface at any point.

- c. Once fully defined, the Front Wing Diveplane must be arranged such that when viewed from above, no part of RS-FW-DP may be visible.
- d. Its complete and final surface must be tangent continuous and any concave radius of curvature must be greater than 50mm.

## 3.9.5 Front Wing Endplate

Once the Front Wing Diveplane and Front Wing Endplate Body are fully defined, the Front Wing Diveplane must be trimmed to the Front Wing Endplate Body to create one unified volume with no remaining overlapping surfaces. Any Front Wing Diveplane bodywork remaining inboard of the Front Wing Endplate Body must be discarded. A fillet radius, no greater than 10mm, may be applied along the intersection between these volumes. Furthermore, once the trim is complete:

- a. Any section of the unified volume taken through an X plane should contain only one closed section.
- b. When viewed from the car centre-plane, no part of the Front Wing Diveplane may be visible.
- c. In order to prevent tyre damage to other cars, the complete Front Wing Endplate must be at least 10mm thick (being the minimum distance when measured normal to the surface in any direction). When assessing this thickness, adjoining parts of the Front Wing Tip may also be considered. Furthermore, with the exception of parts of the Front Wing Endplate that lie on the shared boundary of RV-FW-EP and RV-FW-TIP a 5mm edge radius must be applied to all extremities.

## 3.9.6 Front Wing Assembly

Once the Front Wing Endplate, Front Wing Profiles and Front Wing Tip are fully defined, they must be trimmed to each other to create one unified volume with no remaining overlapping surfaces. Furthermore, the external surfaces at the boundaries between adjacent sections of the Front Wing Endplate, Front Wing Profiles and Front Wing Tip, must maintain both continuity and tangency in any X, Y, or Z plane.

## 3.9.7 Adjustability of Front Wing

Once the Front Wing Assembly has been defined in accordance with Article 3.9.6, a continuous portion of either the rearmost or the two rearmost profiles (including any Gurney rigidly attached to it) may be adjustable for the sole purpose of trimming front wing aerodynamic load. This adjustable part of the Front Wing Profiles will be called the FW Flap.

The axis of rotation of the adjustable part of the wing must:

- a. Pass through points A and B where:
- i. Point A lies within the volume of the FW Flap, no more than 25mm from its forward most point at this Y and between Y=200 and Y=400.
- ii. Point B lies within the volume of FW Flap, no more than 25mm from its forward most point at this Y and between Y=825 and Y=850.
- b. Be no more than 70mm from the FW Flap at any point between points A and B.
- c. Once the axis of rotation AB has been defined, two surfaces of revolution must be defined. These surfaces must:
- i. Have the axis AB as their axis of revolution, and respectively pass through points A (one surface) or B (the other surface).
- ii. Extend over the complete chord of the FW Flap, thus clearly defining its boundaries in relation to the non-adjustable part of the Front Wing Profiles.
- iii. Over their intersection with the FW Flap at its original design position (defined in accordance to Article 3.9.1), have a normal which does not subtend an angle greater than 30deg to the Y axis.

Furthermore:

26 February 2025

- d. Compared to the original position of these profiles (as defined in accordance with Article 3.9.1), adjustment may only permit an increase of incidence of the slope defined in Article 3.9.1.g, and the maximum deviation for any point of these profiles from its original position must not exceed 40mm. Physical stops must be provided to prevent the FW Flap from being adjusted beyond these limits.
- e. Minimal exceptions to the geometrical criteria of Article 3.9.1 for the wing profiles may be made in the junction between the adjustable and non-adjustable parts, in order to ensure the necessary level of sealing. Such parts must lie within 3mm from one of the two surfaces of revolution and their maximum size must be the minimum necessary amount required to achieve a 20mm overlap between the adjustable and the non-adjustable parts of the profiles over the whole range of movement In the case where the trailing edge of the rearmost element is trimmed, any such parts with minimal exceptions can remain untrimmed, provided that the remaining parts extend no more than 20mm behind the trimmed trailing edge.

For the avoidance of doubt, the adjustment permitted under this Article is only allowed when the car is stationary and by the use of a tool, and in accordance with the Sporting Regulations.

Furthermore, any such variation of incidence must maintain compliance with all of the bodywork regulations, with the exception of Article 3.9.1.

All bodywork to be rotated shall be known as 'DRS Bodywork'

The state of deployment is defined as starting when the adjustment of the DRS bodywork away from its original geometry defined by Articles 3.10.1 and 3.10.5 has been commanded by direct driver input and controlled using the control electronics specified in Article 8.3, and ending when the DRS bodywork has been returned to that same original geometry, having been disabled by the control electronics.

Except in the event of a DRS failure or the transitioning from one position into the other the DRS bodywork can have only 2 positions, such that the DRS Bodywork position must be the same before and after each state of deployment. The transition time between the 2 positions must be less than 400ms.

## Furthermore:

- a. No part of the ' DRS Bodywork  may lie outboard of Y=490. '

26 February 2025

In order to achieve the above adjustment, the actuator mechanism and any associated minimal fairings must lie inboard of Y=25, below Z=940 and not extend beyond RV-RW-PROFILES in the forward or rearward direction, when viewed from above. Furthermore, any additional minimal bodywork associated with the adjustment of the DRS Bodywork must be located outboard of Y= 465 and in side-view be below the top surface of RV-RW-PROFILES, must not be visible from below and must fit within a cuboid which is 30mm wide, 60mm long and 30mm high. This cuboid may have a free orientation in space, but its width must be aligned with the axis of rotation of the RW flap.

26 February 2025

## 3.13 Wheel bodywork

## 3.13.1 General principles

Geometry declared as 'Front Wheel Bodywork' and 'Rear Wheel Bodywork' must comprise of all the components described in Articles 3.13.2 to 3.13.7.

When referred to individually, these components will have the words 'Front' or 'Rear' added to the component name.

Any criteria of visibility will assume that the sprung mass, the suspension, the RS-FWH-DRUM assembly, the drum to wheel seals and the complete wheels have been removed, and will be considered in the orthogonal frame of reference of the wheel (XW, YW, ZW).

With the exception of the Wheel Covers and minimal flexible parts for the sole purpose of allowing an aerodynamic seal to be maintained to the suspension members and wheels, the Wheel Bodywork must:

- a. Be rigid and rigidly secured to the suspension uprights (rigidly secured means not having any degree of freedom).
- b. Not be rigidly secured to the suspension members.

## 3.13.2 Drum

The Front and Rear Drums must be made respectively to the geometry defined by RS-FWH-DRUM and RS-RWH-DRUM .

For each drum, a circumferential, continuous (around an arc of 360°), and uniform aerodynamic seal must be fitted in the outboard of the two annotated volumes, in order to prevent any significant aerodynamic or heat transfer flow between the drum and the axle.

An optional aerodynamic seal may be fitted in the inboard of the two annotated volumes between the drum and the wheel rim. If fitted, this seal must be circumferential, continuous (around an arc of 360°), and uniform.

Notwithstanding this specification, the following modifications will be permitted inboard of YW= -5:

- a. Apertures where suspension members or suspension fairings intersect the surface of the Drum. These apertures must be minimal in size in order to permit the full articulation of the suspension system (and for the front, also the steering system). Furthermore, they must be internally sealed in such way so as to prevent any air flow from another aperture.
- b. Minor fixing details to permit the attachment of the Drum Deflectors described in Articles 3.13.5 and 3.13.6.
- c. An aperture contained within the periphery of the intersection between the Scoop defined in Article 3.13.3 and the Drum.
- d. Minor modifications to the front drum between ZW=155 and ZW=230, providing these are for the sole purpose of permitting the outboard suspension to connect to the upright and do not protrude from the original surface into the external air stream.

## 3.13.3 Scoop

The Front and Rear Scoop must lie within RV-FWH-SCO and RV-RWH-SCO respectively.

Any part of the Scoop which is in contact with the external air stream must be tangent continuous and be fully visible when viewed parallel to the YW axis from inboard. These criteria will be assessed prior to the addition of apertures detailed in (c), (d) and (g).

Furthermore, with the exception of any Rear Scoop surfaces rearward of XW=0, the Scoop must satisfy the following criteria:

- a. For the parts of the Scoop's surfaces that are visible when viewed parallel to the Y W axis from inboard, the radius of curvature must be greater than 20mm.

- b. Any intersection with a YW plane must produce only, a single closed section for the Front Scoop, and a single section for the Rear Scoop.

Once the Front and Rear Scoop have been defined, they must be trimmed to RS-FWH-DRUM and RS-RWH-DRUM respectively, and a fillet radius no greater than 20mm may be applied at their boundaries.

Once the Front and Rear Scoops have been trimmed to their respective drums, the following apertures may be added:

- c. A single inlet aperture, with a periphery which:
- i. Must lie within RV-FWH-SCO and RV-RWH-SCO respectively and may not be more than 200mm when measured in ZW.
- ii. Has no point more than 50mm from any other point on the periphery of the aperture when measured in XW and has no point rearward of XW= -100.
- d. A single outlet aperture, with a periphery which:
- i. Must lie within RV-FWH-SCO and RV-RWH-SCO respectively be fully visible from the rear and must lie above ZW= -50.
- ii. For the Front Scoop, has no point more than 75mm from any other point on the periphery of the aperture when measured in XW and has no point forward of XW=100.
- iii. For the Rear Scoop, has no point on the periphery of the aperture forward of XW=100

Once the Rear Scoop has been defined, trimmed to its drum, and the apertures permitted in c. and d. applied, the following geometry may be added:

- e. A single Rear Scoop Lip which must lie within RV-RWH-LIP. Furthermore:
- i. Its complete surface must be tangent continuous and contain no more than a single section in any XW plane.
- ii. For the parts of the Rear Scoop Lip surface that are visible when viewed parallel to the YW axis from inboard, the radius of curvature must be greater than 20mm . This is with the exception of regions of its surface that are within 5mm of the boundary of the Rear Scoop Lip when viewed parallel to the YW axis from inboard .
- iii. Once the Rear Scoop Lip has been fully defined, it must be trimmed to the Rear Scoop and Rear Drum, such that no overlapping surfaces remain, and a fillet radius of no greater than 25mm may be applied at their boundaries. Once the fillet radius has been applied the external surfaces at the boundaries between adjacent sections of the Rear Scoop Lip and the Rear Scoop and Rear Drum must maintain tangent continuity in any XW, YW or ZW plane
- f. Once the requirements of paragraph e) above have been satisfied, additional geometry may be added to the combined rear drum and scoop surfaces, for the sole purpose of protecting the scoop inlet from debris ingestion, providing this geometry satisfies the following criteria:
- i. its entire surface sits within either RV-RWH-LIP or RV-RWH-SCP
- ii. before the bodies are trimmed to the Rear Scoop, Rear Lip or Rear Drum, the additional geometry must not contain any open sections in any Xw, Yw and Zw planes
- iii. on any Yw plane, any individual closed section must have a cross-sectional area less than 8mm 2 , with the exception of a fillet radius of no larger than 5mm at the boundaries.

Once the Front and Rear Scoop have been defined, trimmed to their respective Drums, had the apertures permitted in c. and d. applied, and in the case of the Rear Wheel Bodywork, the Rear Scoop Lip has been fully defined and trimmed to the Rear Scoop and Rear Drum, the following additional apertures may be added:

26 February 2025

- g. Apertures for suspension members or suspension fairings. These apertures must be minimal in size in order to permit the full articulation of the suspension system (and for the front, also the steering system). Furthermore, they must be internally sealed in such way so as to prevent any air flow from another aperture.

With the exception of minimal incidental leakage, all and only air entering the inlet aperture described in point (c), must exit out of the outlet aperture described in point (d). Furthermore, any flow line linking the inlet to the outlet must pass through a YW plane outboard of YW= -50, with the exception of ducts solely for cooling electrical components.

For clarity, apertures as referred to in this Article are considered to be mathematical surfaces that are coincident with the surfaces constructed in accordance with Article 3.13.3 and bound by their peripheries. Any criterion of visibility in this Article will consider these surfaces to be non-transparent.

## 3.13.4 Internal Cooling Ducts

Any bodywork which is situated within the volume defined by the drum and the scoop will be considered to be part of the internal Cooling Ducts and be classed as LTC.

## 3.13.5 Front Drum Deflector

The Front Drum Deflector must be made to the geometry defined by RS-FWH-DEFL .

In order to adapt the component of the Front Drum Deflector forward of XW= -30 to the local flow conditions, a +/-6° tolerance in its incidence will be accepted. Any such rotation must be made about a ZW-aligned axis through the point [XW= -260, YW= -10].

The parts of the permitted component above and below Zw= -110 may be adjusted as separate rigid bodies, by different amounts. To allow the parts of the resultant Front Drum Deflector to blend smoothly into one another, the angle of adjustment may vary within the regions between ZW= -110 and ZW= -70 and between ZW=110 and ZW=150. Within each of these two regions, the angle of adjustment must vary monotonically along ZW. The final surfaces must maintain both continuity and tangency across all boundaries of these regions. At ZW=150 continuity and tangency must be maintained to the Front Drum.

Bodywork may be added to further adapt the Front Drum Deflector components. Any such bodywork must:

- a. Lie within one of the following volumes. Each volume is defined by a four-sided simple polygon with vertices at the following points on YW=0, extruded along YW to the given value:
- i. [XW, ZW] = [-195, -130], [-195, -115], [-155, -115], [-155, -130], extruded to YW=50.
- ii. [XW, ZW] = [-85, -182], [-85, -170], [-70, -170], [-70, -182], extruded to YW=100.
- iii. [XW, ZW] = [27, -176], [41, -136], [81, -167], [77, -179], extruded to YW=56.
- iv. [XW, ZW] = [79, -144], [88, -100], [135, -126], [132, -139], extruded to YW=60.
- v. [XW, ZW] = [28, -189], [32, -145], [92, -153], [88, -193] extruded to YW=106, with regions outboard of YW=55 removed.

Existing regions of the Front Drum Deflector within the volumes defined in (iii), (iv) and (v) may be trimmed away, provided that any new surfaces that result from the trim are not in contact with the external air stream once the added bodywork of this article is applied.

- b. Be solely for the purposes of adding flow aligned leading edges to the rearward component of the Front Drum Deflector, or adding flow aligned stays to the forward component.
- c. Not obscure any part of the Front Drum Deflector when viewed from the car centre plane. This applies only to bodywork within the volumes defined in (a.i) or (a.ii).

26 February 2025

## d. In any YW plane:

- i. Maintain both continuity and tangency to the remaining Front Drum Deflector surfaces. This does not apply to bodywork within the volumes defined in (a.i) and (a.ii).
- ii. Contain no more than one closed section in each volume defined in (a).
- iii. Have no part of the section visible from above that is more than 15mm distant from the section visible from below. This does not apply to bodywork within the volume defined in (a.v).
- iv. Have an XW-dimension of at least 30mm in each of the volumes defined in (a.iii), (a.iv) or (a.v), when combined with any remaining Front Deflector Surfaces within the same volume. This does not apply if the original geometry prior to the trimming permitted in (a) is below this minimum dimension.
- v. Have an XW-dimension no greater than 20mm. This applies only to bodywork within the volume defined in (a.i).

Once the added bodywork has been defined in accordance with this article, it is trimmed to RS-FWH-DRUM, the bodywork added in the volumes defined in (a.i) and (a.ii) is trimmed to Front Drum Deflector, and a fillet radius of no greater than 5mm may be added at the intersections between these surfaces. The resultant bodies are considered to be part of the Front Drum Deflector.

## 3.13.6 Rear Drum Deflector

The Rear Drum Deflector must be made to the geometry defined by RS-RWH-DEFL, with the exception of surfaces below the annotated curve 'TRIM LINE' in RS-RWH-DEFL which may be trimmed.  The part of the resulting trimmed Rear Drum Deflector below the annotated curve 'SINGLE SECTION LINE' in RS-RWH-DEFL must produce only a single section when intersected with any ZW or XW plane.

In order to adapt the Rear Drum Deflector to the local flow conditions, a +/-10mm tolerance in its Z W position and a +/-5° tolerance in its incidence about the annotated axis in RS-RWH-DEFL will be accepted. Any translation in ZW includes the rotation axis and is applied before the rotation.

Once the Drum deflector has been positioned and adjusted in accordance with its specification, it must be trimmed to the Rear Drum and a maximum fillet radius, no greater than 5mm, may be applied along the intersections between these surfaces.

## 3.13.7 Wheel Cover

A single Wheel Cover per wheel, must be rigidly secured to the wheel rim such that it has the same rotational velocity as the wheel it is connected to and forms an aerodynamic seal to the wheel rim. The outboard surface of the Wheel Cover must be made to the geometry defined by RS-FWH-COV for the front wheels and by RS-RWH-COV for the rear wheels.

The Wheel Covers are classed as SSC.

## 3.14 Suspension Fairings

3.14.1 Suspension Fairings must be fitted to all suspension members defined in Article 10.3.6, with the exception of those of circular cross section.

Each suspension fairing must:

- a. Fully cover the suspension member it corresponds to and any other components supported on it, such as hydraulic brake lines, electrical wiring and wheel tethers (all of which must be supported on a suspension member), over the span exposed to the external air stream.
- b. Be rigid and rigidly secured to the suspension member (rigidly secured means not having any degree of freedom).

26 February 2025

Minimal deformation will nonetheless be accepted for suspension conforming to Article 10.3.3. In such cases, any shared cover sections may deform or articulate a minimal amount to accommodate nominal misalignment of the relevant suspension members through the suspension travel range.

Furthermore, the surface bounded by the external cross-sections of each suspension fairing, when taken normal to the load line defined in Article 10.3.6 (a), must:

- c. Intersect the load line. With the exception of front suspension elements, locally, for the sole purpose of ensuring minimum clearance with the wheel rim at full steering lock.
- d. Have at least one axis of symmetry, of which the larger one will be called the 'major axis'.
- e. Have no dimension which exceeds 100mm, or 150mm only where a single fairing per side is used to shroud the driveshaft in addition to a suspension member.
- f. Up to two suspension fairings per side may be trimmed to allow the passage of the driveshaft. In such cases, compliance with the remainder of this Article must be demonstrated before the strictly necessary removal of any fairing material related to the passage of the driveshaft.
- g. Have an aspect ratio no greater than 3.5:1, that being defined as the ratio of the major axis to the maximum thickness, measured in the direction normal to the major axis. Furthermore, no dimension may be more than 5mm larger than the major axis.
- h. Have an incidence (defined as the angle between the major axis and Z=0 with the car at its legality ride height, as defined in Article 10.1.4.) which lies within the following ranges:
- i. For the Front Suspension Fairings, between 10° (nose down) and 0°
- ii. For the Rear Suspension Fairings, between 10° (nose down) and -10° (nose up)
- 3.14.2 Fairings of suspension members which share an attachment point will be considered by a virtual dissection into discrete components. Such fairings will be allowed local minimal exceptions to Article 3.14.1 (d), (g) and (h) close to the junction of the suspension members, including minimal cut outs to allow the passage of a suspension member connected inboard to the rockers defined in Article 10.4.1. After application of any such cut out, the resultant fairings must still seal the internal volume of the fairings from the external airstream.
- 3.14.3 The angle between the normal to any point of the surface of a suspension fairing and a plane normal to the corresponding suspension member's load line must not exceed 15deg. Legitimate exceptions to this constraint will be accepted close to the inner and outer attachment points, or close to the junction between suspension members that share an attachment.
- 3.14.4 In order to permit suspension travel while maintaining an aerodynamic seal, minimal flexible components may be fitted between the Suspension Fairings and the following components:
- a. The Front Bodywork defined in Article 3.6.
- b. The Tail Bodywork defined in Article 3.8.
- c. The Wheel Bodywork defined in Article 3.13.
- d. The gearbox case as defined in Article 9.1.7
- e. The suspension fairing covering the suspension member connected inboard to the rockers defined in Article 10.4.1.

With the car at its legality ride height, these flexible components must:

- f. Contain a fillet radius of up to 30mm between the components they are sealing.
- g. Other than the fillet radius described above, conform with the shape restrictions of either of the two components they are sealing to each other. For clarity, parts of these components may be replaced with the flexible component.

- h. Be designed in such way as to maintain their shape integrity with the car in motion, and as much as possible, with the suspension at another position than that of the Legality Ride Height.

Minimal exceptions to (f) and (g) are permitted between the Suspension Fairings and the Front Wheel Bodywork and between the Fairing of the Front Trackrod and the Front Bodywork. These exceptions are for the sole purpose of introducing a pleat into the flexible component to allow steering articulation without compromising the structural integrity of the flexible component. With the suspension at the Legality Ride Height and wheels in the straight-ahead position, these pleats must be internal to the volume bound by the fillet radius referred to in (f) above.

## 3.15 Aerodynamic Component Flexibility

## 3.15.1 Introduction of load/deflection tests

In order to ensure that the requirements of Article 3.2.2 are respected, the FIA reserves the right to introduce further load/deflection tests on any part of the bodywork which appears to be (or is suspected of), moving whilst the car is in motion.

## 3.15.2 Load/deflection linearity

All load deflection tests must have a nominally linear elastic relationship unless otherwise stated.

## 3.15.3 Rear Wing Skins

The skins of the rear wing elements may deflect no more than 2mm when a 60N force is applied to the skin normal to and away from the element.

The force will be applied using a vacuum cup of 50mm diameter and the deflection will be measured at the outer diameter of the cup.

## 3.15.4 Front Wing Bodywork Flexibility

The flexibility of Front Wing Bodywork will be tested by applying a load of [0, 0, -1000]N at points [XF, Y, Z] = [-800, ±800, 250] or [-1000, ±800, 250].

The load will be applied in a downward direction using a 50mm diameter ram on a rectangular adaptor measuring 350mm in the X-direction and 150mm in the Y-direction. This adaptor must be supplied by the team and should:

- a. Have a flat top surface without recesses.
- b. Be fitted to the car so as to apply the full load to the bodywork at the test point and not to increase the rigidity of the parts being tested.
- c. Be placed with the inner face 725mm from Y=0.
- d. Be placed with its forward face at XF=-1100mm.
- e. Be placed with its top face at Z=250
- f. Have a mass of no more than 2kg.

The deflection will be measured relative to the survival cell and along the loading axis.

When the load is applied symmetrically to both sides of the car the vertical deflection must be no more than 15mm.

When the load is applied to only one side of the car the vertical deflection must be no more than 20mm.

From 28 May 2025 onwards:

When the load is applied symmetrically to both sides of the car the vertical deflection must be no more than 10mm.

26 February 2025

When the load is applied to only one side of the car the vertical deflection must be no more than 15mm.

## 3.15.5 Front Wing Flap Flexibility

Any part of the trailing edge of any front wing flap may deflect no more than 5mm, when measured along the loading axis, when a 60N point load is applied normal to the flap.

From 28 May 2025 onwards:

Any part of the trailing edge of any front wing flap may deflect no more than 3mm, when measured along the loading axis, when a 60N point load is applied normal to the flap.

## 3.15.6 Front Floor Flexibility

Bodywork flexibility will be tested by applying a load vertically upwards using a 50mm diameter pad with a gimbled interface to the loadcell. The position of the centre of the pad will be given by the FIA and will be on the underside of the plank within a quadrilateral area, with vertices at points [XF=460, 50], [XF=610, 65], [XF=610, -65], [XF=460, -50]. The deflection will be measured along the loading axis.

At all times during the test, the load at a given deflection must exceed the load given by a straight-line graph defined by connecting the following coordinates in order: (0 mm, 0 N) (1 mm, 0 N) (5 mm, 4000N) (25mm, 6000N). This must be the case whether the deflection is increasing, decreasing, or held constant. The test will have no more than a maximum load of 8000N or a maximum deflection of 15mm (whichever is reached first) unless specifically requested by the FIA to investigate behaviour above these limits.

The load deflection relationship must be strictly monotonic with both increasing and decreasing deflection.

## 3.15.7 Outboard Floor Flexibility

The outboard edge of the Floor Bodywork Group may deflect no more than 8mm in Z at any point between XR = -1260 and XR = -350 when a distributed load of [0, 0, -600]N is applied to each side of the car.

The load will be applied simultaneously at 6 points on each side of the car, nominally at: [XR, Y] = [-480, 652.2], [-635, 686.3], [-790, 714.4], [-945, 736.7], [-1100, 753.3], and [-1255, 764.2]. A 2mm tolerance on position will be permitted for manufacturing reasons.

When viewed from above, and with the Floor Bodywork Group as fully defined in Article 3.5.6 in place, nothing other than the bodywork may be visible within 15mm of any load application point. A load application point that does not meet this requirement may be moved, in X and/or in Y, by the minimum amount necessary to comply. The FIA may require load points to be moved if, in their view, the load location or the floor shape has been specifically designed to permit greater levels of outboard floor flexibility in untested regions of the floor.

Once the load application positions are fully defined, Teams must provide a suitable means of applying the load to the upper surface of the bodywork. The load will be applied through a rod of diameter 2.3mm. Details of this arrangement are provided in the appendix to the Technical and Sporting Regulations. The contact of any load-spreader with the bodywork must lie within a cylinder of diameter 25mm, coaxial with the load application axis. If the Team's preferred method requires through-holes, these holes must be sealed on either or both of the upper and lower surfaces at all times the car is on the circuit and during any assessment of any visibility from above around load application points.

Loads will be applied to these rods in two stages:

- i. [0, 0, -50]N to each load application point to give 300N per side.

- ii. [0, 0, -100]N to each load application point to give 600N per side.

Deflection will be measured by laser scanning of the bodywork at each loading stage.

## 3.15.8 Central Floor Flexibility

- a. Bodywork within RV-PLANK may deflect no more than 2mm at the two holes in the plank at XF=1080 and no more than 2mm at the rearmost hole, when the car, without driver, is supported at these positions. The car will be supported on 70mm diameter pads, centred on the holes, and only in contact with the underside of the plank assembly. The displacement will be measured at the supports, relative to the reference plane at the centre of each hole.

Furthermore, the stiffness for any deflection exceeding that defined in the previous paragraph must be no less than 15kN/mm.

Competitors will be required to demonstrate the local vertical stiffness and design installation of the skids and plank to the FIA for the regions around the periphery of each of these three holes. Compliance with Article 3.5.9.e. will only be assessed in the regions that are at least 90% as stiff as the stiffest part of the periphery. Any designs intended to protect these regions of the periphery from wear will not be accepted.

Competitors will be required to demonstrate compliance with these provisions by way of a detailed inspection of both the CAD and the physical installation, as well as Finite Element analysis.

- b. Bodywork on the reference plane may deflect no more than 0.2mm when the car, without driver, is supported at the two holes in the plank at XF=1080 and at the rearmost hole in the plank. The car will be supported on 40mm diameter pads, centred on the holes, and only contacting the bodywork on the reference plane. For the two holes at XF=1080 the displacement will be measured at the supports, relative to the survival cell datum points detailed in Article 3.2.6. For the rearmost hole the displacement will be measured at the support, relative to the power unit at the uppermost transmission mounting studs detailed in Article 5.4.8.

## 3.15.9 Rear Wing Mainplane Flexibility

- a. Bodywork may not deflect more than 6mm along the loading axis and 1.0° in a Y-plane, when two loads of [0, 0, -1000]N each, are applied simultaneously to the Rear Wing Profiles. The loads will be applied at [XR=375, ±300, 910]
- b. Bodywork may not deflect more than 6mm along the loading axis and 1.0° in a Y-plane, when two loads of [324, 0, -940]N each, are applied simultaneously to the Rear Wing Profiles. The loads will be applied at [XR=325, ±300, 900]

The loads in (a) and (b) will be applied through adaptors, supplied by the team, that lie between 250mm and 350mm from Y=0 and between XR=90 and at least XR=500. The upper surface each adaptor must lie at Z=910 and should have a counterbore of 52mm diameter for the application of the load in (b).

The angular deflection will be measured on the rear wing profiles, at [XR, Y] [350, ±150], and [350, ±450] and relative to the Rear Impact Structure. Teams must provide four pads to support tracking targets. Details of the targets is given in the Appendix to the Technical and Sporting Regulations.

The tests defined in this article may be performed with the RW Flap removed. In such cases the permitted deflections will be 25% higher than those defined in (a) and (b).

## 3.15.10 Rear Wing Flap Flexibility

The RW Flap may deflect no more than 7mm horizontally when a 500N load is applied horizontally. The load will be applied in the plane Z=875 at one of three separate points which lie within 50mm of the car centre plane and 270mm either side of it. The loads will be applied in a rearward direction using a suitable 25mm wide adaptor which must be supplied by the relevant team.

26 February 2025

The deflection will be measured along the loading axis and relative to the forward part of the Rear Wing Mainplane at the same Y-station.

## 3.15.11 Rear Wing Mainplane Trailing Edge

The forward-most aerofoil element of Rear Wing Profiles may deflect no more than 3mm along the line of load application, when a 200N load is applied normal to the lower surface. The load will be applied in line with the trailing edge of the element at Y=0, Y=±125, or at Y=±375.

The deflection will be measured relative to the forward part of the Rear Wing Mainplane at the same Y-station.

The loads will be applied using a suitable adaptor, supplied by the relevant team, which:

- i. May be no more than 50mm wide.
- ii. Which extends no more than 10mm forward of the trailing edge.
- iii. Incorporates an 8mm female thread in the underside.

## 3.15.12 Beam Wing Flexibility

- a. No element within RV-RW-BEAM may deflect more than 3mm when a load of 150N is applied to its trailing edge, normal to the lower surface of the element. Two loads of 150N will be applied simultaneously at Y=270 and Y=-270 and 5mm forward (measured along the lower surface) of the local trailing edge.

The deflection will be measured along the line of load application, relative to the Rear Impact Structure.

The loads will be applied using adaptors, no more than 60mm wide, supplied by the relevant team. These adaptors must conform to the specification given in the Appendix to the Technical and Sporting Regulations.

- b. No element within RV-RW-BEAM may deflect more than 0.8deg in a Y-plane when two loads of 150N are applied to its trailing edge simultaneously at Y= 270 and Y=-270 . The loads will be applied 5mm forward (measured along the lower surface) of the local trailing edge, in the specified Y-plane, and normal to the section through the lower surface.

The angular deflection will be measured on the beam wing profile being tested at Y=±270 and relative to the Rear Impact Structure.

Teams must provide adaptors, no more than 60mm wide, which may enclose the beam wing profile being tested. These adaptors must provide a pad to support an inclinometer and must conform to the specification given in the Appendix to the Technical and Sporting Regulations.

## 3.15.13   Rear Wing Endplate Flexibility

The endplates described in article 3.10.4 may deflect no more than 10mm, when measured along the loading axis, when a 50N point load is applied in an inward direction normal to the car centre plane using a spherical 15mm diameter tip at [XR, Z] = [635, 585]. For this measurement, the contribution of the rigid-body rotation of the whole wing assembly will be removed.

## 3.15.14 Front Drum Flexibility

Bodywork defined by RS-FWH-DRUM may deflect no more than 5mm, vertically, when a 60N load is applied vertically downwards at [XW=0, YW=-100, ZW=425]. The load will be applied using an adaptor provided by the FIA.

## 3.15.15 Rear Wing Slot Gap Deflection

With the hydraulic system active and the DRS deployed, a spherical gauge must not pass through the gap between the two elements within RV-RW-Profiles. The gauge will have a diameter of 85mm +0.00 / -0.05mm and a load of 30N will be applied during the test.

26 February 2025

## 3.15.16 Additional Diagnostics

To allow the behaviour of the Rear Wing to be monitored using the onboard cameras, contrasting markers must be applied to bodywork within RV-RW-PROFILES and within RVRW-BEAM. Details of these markers and their positions are given in the Appendix to the Technical and Sporting Regulations.

## 3.15.17   Rear wing mainplane tip flexibility

The distance between the two sections of RV-RW-PROFILES and RV-RW-TIP inboard of Y=525, must not vary more than 2mm when two loads of [0,0, -750]N each, are applied simultaneously to the Rear Wing Profile forward most section only. The loads will be applied at [XR=330, ±525, 910].

The loads will be applied through adaptors, supplied by the Competitor, that lie between 490mm and 610mm from Y=0 with a maximum plan view area of 15000mm 2  each side. The upper surface of each adaptor must lie at Z=910. The adaptors must not contact with the Rear Wing Tip most rearward profile at any time, the shapes must allow fitment and removal with vertical (Z axis) movement only.

## 3.16 Aerodynamic Component construction

## 3.16.1 Front Wing Endplate

The bodywork declared as Front Wing Endplate in Article 3.9.5 must be made to the laminate PL-ANTI-SPLINTER .

Fasteners and related inserts, for the purpose of attaching the front wing endplate to the profiles must be positioned at least 30mm rearward of the leading edge of the endplate.

## 3.16.2 Suspension Fairings

Suspension Fairings as defined in Article 3.14 must be made to the laminate PL-SUS-FAIRING . Additional reinforcing plies may be added to this laminate where necessary.

26 February 2025

## ARTICLE 4: MASS

## 4.1 Minimum mass

The mass of the car, without fuel, must not be less than 800kg plus the Heat Hazard Mass Increase (defined in Article 4.7), at any time during the Competition.

If, when required for checking, a car is not already fitted with dry-weather tyres, its mass will be determined using a set of dry-weather tyres selected by the FIA technical delegate.

## 4.2 Mass distribution

With the car resting on a horizontal plane the mass measured at the front and rear axles must not be less than the mass specified in Article 4.1 factored by 0.446 and 0.539 respectively at all times during the Sprint Qualifying and Qualifying sessions. Rounding will be to nearest 0.5kg.

If, when required for checking, a car is not already fitted with dry-weather tyres, its mass will be determined using a set of dry-weather tyres selected by the FIA technical delegate.

If, when required for checking, a Heat Hazard has been declared, the increase in mass will not be considered.

## 4.3 Mass of tyres

The mass limit specified in Article 4.1 and the factors specified in Article 4.2 will be adjusted up or down according to any differences (rounded to the nearest 1kg for Article 4.1) between the total set and individual axle set mass respectively of the dry-weather tyres used in the Championship taking place in the calendar year referred to in the title and the preceding year's Championship.

## 4.4 Ballast

Ballast can be used provided it is secured in such a way that tools are required for its removal and that it remains immobile with respect to the sprung mass in its entirety. It must be possible to fix seals if deemed necessary by the FIA technical delegate.

Competitors must show by calculation that the any ballast fitted within the cockpit would be retained in place if any one of its fixings were removed and it were subjected to a 100g acceleration in any direction.

Ballast designated for the purpose of achieving the driver mass specified in Article 4.6.2 must:

- a. Be entirely located to the car between the front and rear extent of the cockpit entry template.
